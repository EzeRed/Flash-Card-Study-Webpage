Start the appication by entering some Flash Cards in the Create Flash Card page.
All flash cards will be on home page as all card be on Word to learn catagory 
by default. You can go the Update Flash Card page and quickly a delete a card or
you can click on a card to edit.
Then you will be taken to edit page to edit a selected flash card. Edit the word
or definition or change the catagory. If you change the catagory to Words Learned,
you will see the card has switched to the Words Learned page.

I think everything seems to be working on the application.

Make sure to install modules (npm install)

node . on the api command line.
